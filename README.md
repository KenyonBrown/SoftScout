# SoftScout: Your SaaS Solution

This Flask app was created as a personal project to make it easier to discover alternatives to known SaaS products.


## Problem

- Software as a Service (SaaS) businesses have been saturating markets at an increased pace over the past few years
- Finding a SaaS service aligned a business’s needs isn’t very difficult, but finding a competitive and comprehensive option can be a timely task
- It would be helpful to use a light-weight application to make it easier to identify viable SaaS solutions


## Solution

- The Searcher.py program takes in user input and scrapes Google's related search function to return a dictionary of the results
- Scraping is powered via Beautifulsoup and Request modules
- User interface is a Flask application linked to a cascading style sheet


## Possible Next Steps

- Build a function to create a custom User Agent for users
- Possibly add a pricing function to return exact prices for each product
- To convert Python into Javascript
- Create a Chrome Extension
